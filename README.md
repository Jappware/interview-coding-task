Before the interview, please

1. Clone this repo.
2. In the `pom.xml` set the `java.version` property to the one installed on your computer.
3. Run the `com.jappware.interview.Main.main()` method. Fix all issues, if any, so that your IDE is ready for the interview.

Once the sample program runs successfully, you are all set.
You will be asked for the next steps during the interview.

Happy interview :)
